# COMP-3025-Assignment

An Exercise Customizer App where users can create and read exercises based on their requirements and age. They can also insert a video link of the exercise, along with a description, number of repetitions and other special notes. This will be especially useful keeping in mind the ongoing pandemic where people don't have access to fitness centres, and they have to stay home. This app will help them do their workouts at home, at any time of the day with no equipment required.
 
In the app, a user can login/sign up using email/google email, add exercises and can read the list of exercises using a recycler view. Plus, only the users who are already registered/logged in can add data into it.
