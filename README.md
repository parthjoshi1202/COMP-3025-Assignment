# COMP-3025-Assignment

An Exercise Customizer App where admins (gym trainers) can create, update, delete exercises based on their clients' requirements and age. They can also insert pictures/videos/video link of the exercise, along with a description, number of repetitions and other special notes. This will be especially useful keeping in mind the ongoing pandemic where people don't have access to fitness centres, and they have to stay home. This app will help them do their workouts at home, at any time of the day with no equipment required. Clients can customize their home workouts by choosing any amount of exercises uploaded by the admins, based on the advice of their trainers (admins) or they can follow their own sequence without consulting (at their own pace). 

For now, a user can login/sign up using email/google email, add exercises (they cannot upload pictures as the functionality isn't fixed up yet) and can read the list of exercises using a recycler view. Plus, anyone can add data into it, authentication rules are really basic.
