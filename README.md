# COMP-3025-Assignment

An Exercise Customizer App where admins (gym trainers) can create, update, delete exercises based on their clients' requirements and age. They can also insert pictures/videos/video link of the exercise, along with a description, number of repetitions and other special notes. This will be especially useful keeping in mind the ongoing pandemic where people don't have access to fitness centres, and they have to stay home. This app will help them do their workouts at home, at any time of the day with no equipment required. Clients can customize their home workouts by choosing any amount of exercises uploaded by the admins, based on the advice of their trainers (admins) or they can follow their own sequence without consulting (at their own pace). 

List of concepts I will need to know- 
1. Accessing Database
2. Changing Scenes
3. Authentication
4. "Pin" an exercise or a specific note
5. Pop-up screens/notifications
6. Filtering/searching data
7. Changing app language to one or more languages
8. Creating your own list of exercises out of available ones (similar to an online shopping cart) (for clients)
9. Resetting the list
10. Marking an exercise as "viewed" or "done" when selected
11. Adding a progress bar / adding functionality to save progress
12. Adding a Calendar/Notepad/Timer wherever required
13. CRUD Functionality (for admins)
